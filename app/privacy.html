<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last Updated: January 5th, 2015</p>

<p>HomeCooked, Inc. (“HomeCooked”, “we,” “our” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and
  procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the website
  (GoHomeCooked.com), our application for mobile devices and/or other services we provide (collectively, the
  “Application”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Application. Please
  review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may revise it without notice. Each time you use the Application or
  provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that
  time. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, and as applicable, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the
  same meanings as in our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Service.</a></p>

<p>By using the Application, you do hereby warrant and represent that you have read, understand and agree to all terms
  and conditions stated herein, including our Terms and Conditions of Use, which is incorporated herein by reference,
  which govern the use of the services offered by HomeCooked, and that you are giving HomeCooked permission to use and
  store such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Service.</p>

<p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer,
  subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including,
  but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring
  information within our organization or among our affiliates.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Application, to administer your use of the
  Application and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Application.</p>

<h2>Log Data</h2>

<p>When you visit the Application, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers
  automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may
  include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were
  visiting before you came to the Application, pages of the Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages,
  information you search for on the Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information
  to monitor and analyze use of the Application and for the Application’s technical administration, to increase the
  Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Application to the needs of HomeCooked’s
  visitors. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Application meet the criteria required to
  process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information (hereinafter defined) or use it in
  association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the
  same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information (hereinafter defined).</p>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<p>We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Application. We use your Personal
  Information to provide our services and administer your inquiries.</p>

<p>When you register with us through the Application and become a registered user, and when you choose to post a meal or
  order a meal, or when you wish to contact another registered user, we will ask you for personally identifiable
  information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Identity
  Information”). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your full name, phone number, email address and
  home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. In order to process some of
  your transactions through the Application, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information
  (“Billing Information”) (Identity Information and Billing Information together, “Personal Information”). If the
  address of a meal you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would be considered Identity
  Information. We reserve the right to require address confirmation for meals included in postings. If we require such
  confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in a posting and ask you to enter the code
  via the Application in order to confirm the address of the meal included in the applicable posting.</p>

<p>You can also register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers (“SNS”)
  (e.g., Facebook); each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via the Application as described below. As part of the
  functionality of the Application, you may link your HomeCooked account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i)
  providing your Third Party Account login information to HomeCooked through the Application; or (ii) allowing
  HomeCooked to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern
  your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login
  information to HomeCooked and/or grant HomeCooked access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to,
  for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your
  use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating HomeCooked to pay any fees or making HomeCooked
  subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS. If you decide to register by logging into a Third
  Party Account via our Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable SNS
  (such as your “real” name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you
  belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize
  HomeCooked to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that
  information to create your HomeCooked account and HomeCooked account profile page and you will become a registered
  user. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such
  Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make
  available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your Third
  Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your HomeCooked account on the Application. If there is
  information about your “friends” or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information
  we obtain about those “friends” or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such
  people have with the applicable SNS.</p>

<p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and
  personalization of your HomeCooked account profile (e.g., including without limitation, zip code (on its own) and
  individual preferences or demographic information) (“Non-Identifying Information”).</p>

<p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to
  provide our services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</p>

<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with
  other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be
  identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or
  combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your
  Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other
  HomeCooked users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the
  Application and to analyze and understand how the Application is used. We may also use the combined information
  without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product or service to you according to
  your preferences or restrictions.</p>

<p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with HomeCooked newsletters, marketing or promotional materials
  and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive
  such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or
  update your “Notifications” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below). Please note that we may also
  use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Application; you may not opt
  out of these notifications.</p>

<h2>Emailing Via a HomeCooked Account</h2>

<p>As part of the Application, HomeCooked users may communicate with other HomeCooked users through certain contact
  features on the Application. Where HomeCooked users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to
  an online form, the message they create will be sent from HomeCooked to those email addresses on their behalf. These
  email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.</p>

<h2>Information Retention</h2>

<p>To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by users
  for an indefinite length of time. HomeCooked understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in
  one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the
  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify member information by erasing it from our database.
  We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information. Also, by using the Application, you do
  hereby represent and warrant that you understand and agree that all information submitted by you through the
  Application or otherwise to HomeCooked becomes the property of HomeCooked and may be used in the sole discretion of
  HomeCooked in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
  computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent
  cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to
  enable certain features of the Application, to better understand how you interact with the Application and to monitor
  aggregate usage by HomeCooked users and web traffic routing on the Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session
  cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Application and then close your browser. Third party
  advertisers on the Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by
  changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
  visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Application or all
  functionality of the Application.</p>

<h2>Web Beacons</h2>

<p>The Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used
  along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how the Application is used and may be used in some of
  our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
  effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

<h2>Phishing</h2>

<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to HomeCooked. Safeguarding
  information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request
  your credit card information, your HomeCooked account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a
  non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal
  Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.</p>

<h1>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Application can be used to facilitate the posting and ordering of meals. Postings for such meals are made
  available via the Application by providers. Meals posted by providers, ratings and reviews of providers and consumers,
  and the Profile Information (hereinafter defined) of providers and consumers, are visible to any HomeCooked user.</p>

<h2>HomeCooked Users</h2>

<p>In order to access certain features of the Application and to order or post a meal, you must register to create an
  account. HomeCooked is an invitation-only service. Users may register for an account as follows: a user is referred to
  the Application, or requests an invitation through the Application. HomeCooked requests user information, such as the
  user’s name, e-mail, zip code and phone number. We will create your HomeCooked account and set up a HomeCooked account
  profile page for you. Your HomeCooked account profile page will include your first name and last initial. Users’
  Identity Information is only disclosed to providers and consumers after a meal order has been confirmed. You can
  select the other items of Personal Information that you wish to be included in your HomeCooked account profile page –
  including, but not limited to, a profile picture, a list of the SNS groups to which you belong, a list of any of your
  SNS friends or connections who are also users of HomeCooked, connections you have established between your account and
  any SNSs, and a biography and links to your postings, if applicable (collectively, your “Profile Information”). We
  will display your Profile Information in your HomeCooked account profile page publicly via the Application, and, with
  your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information
  will be publicly visible to all HomeCooked users and consequently should reflect how much you want other HomeCooked
  users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members
  to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and
  revise your Profile Information at any time. Please see our Terms and Conditions of Service ([PROVIDE LINK]) for
  further information on becoming a user.</p>

<h2>Postings</h2>

<p>If you post a meal, we may publish that posting publicly via the Application and may enable third parties to publish
  your posting on their websites through the use of an HTML “widget.” We may also display the geographical location of
  your posting in the form of a map so that potential consumers can see the general area and neighborhood of your
  posting, but your actual street address (and your additional Identity Information) will not be disclosed until you
  enter into a confirmed transaction with another user.</p>

<p>If you request to make an order via the Application, HomeCooked will share the following information about you with
  the applicable provider: (i) your first and last name, (ii) a link to your HomeCooked account profile page, (iii) the
  names of any members of an SNS with whom you are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also
  “friends” or associated with the provider on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that you provided to
  HomeCooked when you became a user matches the name that you provided to the SNSs to which you have linked your
  HomeCooked account. All of this information will enable the provider to decide whether to confirm or reject your
  order. Prior to such confirmation or rejection, we will share the provider’s Identity Information, including, but not
  limited to, full name, phone number, the meal’s address and the provider’s email address, with the applicable consumer
  selected by the provider. When a provider confirms an order, we will share the consumer’s Identity Information with
  the provider, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number and email address, so that the consumer and
  provider may contact one another directly. In no event is a consumer’s Billing Information shared with a provider.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Application, to provide the Application on our
  behalf, to perform Application-related services (e.g., including without limitation, maintenance services, database
  management, web analytics, fraud detection services relating to the activity of HomeCooked users and improvement of
  the Application’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Application is used. These third parties may have
  access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our
  behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal
  Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on
  goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such
  communications. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a HomeCooked user’s prior
  visits to the Application. You can disable these specific cookies that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up
  advertising by opting out at <a
    href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose
  Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other
  purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>HomeCooked cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with
  the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as
  we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
  limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of HomeCooked or a third party, to protect the safety of the
  public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal,
  unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p>We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials and to our insurance services
  providers as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to administer the Application, to protect
  the property and rights of HomeCooked or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to
  prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally
  actionable activity. </p>

<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>

<p>All users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting
  us at homecookedinc@gmail.com or editing the relevant part of their profile. If you would like us to cancel your
  HomeCooked account, please contact us or select the “Cancel Account” feature of the Application and we will attempt to
  accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation or a legitimate business reason to retain the
  information contained in your HomeCooked account. Please note that, if you cancel your HomeCooked account, any reviews
  you have posted via the Application will remain publicly viewable via the Application.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

<p>HomeCooked may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in
  connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>HomeCooked is very concerned with safeguarding your information. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit
  card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology
  (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both
  during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
  storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions
  about security on the Application, you can contact us at homecookedinc@gmail.com.</p>

<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your
  unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach
  notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Application in the most expedient time possible and
  without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any
  measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

<p>Your HomeCooked account is password-protected so that only you and authorized HomeCooked employees have access to
  your account information. If you have registered for the Application using Facebook Connect, then your login and
  password shall be the same as your Facebook login and password. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your
  password to anyone. HomeCooked staff will never proactively reach out to you and ask for any personal account
  information, including your password. If you share a computer, you should sign out of your HomeCooked account and
  close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public
  terminals from disclosure to third parties.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>The Application may contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner
  ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s
  website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an
  endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of
  their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites.
  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal
  information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
  information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you
  visit.</p>

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<p>With your consent we may post your testimonial on the Application along with your name. If you want your testimonial
  removed please contact us at homecookedinc@gmail.com. </p>

<h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>

<p>The Application is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
  information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with
  Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at homecookedinc@gmail.com. If we become aware
  that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
