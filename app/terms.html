<h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE</h1>

<p>Last Updated: December 19th, 2014</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE (&ldquo;TERMS&rdquo;) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE
  (GOHOMECOOKED.COM), APPLICATION AND/OR SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, THE &ldquo;APPLICATION&rdquo;) OFFERED BY HOMECOOKED,
  INC. (&ldquo;HOMECOOKED,&rdquo; &ldquo;WE,&rdquo; &ldquo;OUR&rdquo;). THESE TERMS SET FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS
  AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE APPLICA TION.</p>

<p>By using the Application in any manner, including without limitation, visiting or browsing the Application, you agree
  to be bound by these Terms, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or
  available by hyperlink. These Terms apply to, and the terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; used herein refer
  to, any and all users of the Application, including without limitation, users who are consumers, providers, viewers,
  customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and/or other materials or services on the Application.</p>

<h2>Eligibility </h2>

<p>HomeCooked&rsquo;s services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older
  who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
  old and that all information you submit to the Application is accurate and truthful. HomeCooked may, in its sole
  discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the Application to any person and/or entity and change its eligibility
  criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Application is
  revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>

<p>You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content and are responsible for any
  and/or all applicable taxes related to your use of the Application. In addition, you must abide by HomeCooked&rsquo;s
  policies as stated in these Terms and HomeCooked&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, and/or any other policies posted by
  HomeCooked. In addition, some services offered through the Application may be subject to additional terms and
  conditions promulgated by HomeCooked from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms
  and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

<h2>How the Application Works </h2>

<p>HomeCooked creates a simple invitation-only marketplace where users can share and exchange home-cooked dishes with
  the click of a button. By using a smartphone application, HomeCooked connects hungry food lovers with local cooking
  enthusiasts in their area. The food is cooked in a home or non-commercial environment and made available for pickup at
  a specified time. In order to provide meals, providers post a photo of the available dish, provide a short headline of
  the meal, and provide additional information such as estimated preparation time, meal price, and lists ingredients,
  including the presence of meat and/or allergen information. To order a meal, a consumer enters her location and is
  redirected to a map of nearby providers. The consumer</p>

<p>selects a meal, and receives a notification with the pickup time and address. Users will be able to rate the
  experience, including the provider, quality of the meal and the interaction with the user.</p>

<p>As stated above, HomeCooked makes available a marketplace or venue with related technology for users to connect
  online for the ordering of meals. HomeCooked is not an owner or operator of food establishments, including without
  limitation, restaurants. HomeCooked does not cook or provide food ingredients for users. Except as otherwise stated in
  these Terms with respect to certain food packaging items, HomeCooked does not provide logistical support for users.
  Similarly, HomeCooked is not a contracting agent or representative of any provider. Instead, HomeCooked&rsquo;s role
  is solely to facilitate the availability of the Application for users and to provide services related thereto as
  stated in these Terms.</p>

<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT (I) HOMECOOKED CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY MEALS AND/OR
  THE CONDITION, QUALITY, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY MEALS; (II) HOMECOOKED IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS AND/OR
  TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS AND/OR OTHER USERS OF THE APPLICATION; AND (III) HOMECOOKED HAS
  NO CONTROL OVER CONDUCT OF PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS AND/OR OTHER USERS OF THE APPLICATION. ACCORDINGLY, ANY TRANSACTIONS
  WILL BE MADE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND HOMECOOKED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL OF THE FOREGOING.</p>

<h2>Payments and Fees </h2>

<p>Upon posting a meal using the Application, providers must state the price a consumer must pay for such meal. Upon
  ordering a meal using the Application, consumers must agree to pay such stated price. The provider will not receive
  any compensation or consideration for providing you a meal other than the amount of the stated price.</p>

<p>As a provider, you acknowledge that (i) you will receive from a consumer the stated price as sole payment for the
  meals you have prepared less the Administrative Fee (defined below) and (ii) you will not request from a consumer or
  receive any compensation or consideration for providing a meal to a consumer other than the amount of the stated
  price.</p>

<p>HomeCooked receives an administrative fee of 15% (the &ldquo;Administrative Fee&rdquo;) of each payment that a
  consumer makes to a provider.</p>

<p>The full amount of the payment of the stated price is charged following completion of your order to your authorized
  credit card and transferred to such provider&rsquo;s account, less the Administrative Fee. ALL PAYMENTS ARE
  NON-REFUNDABLE. Please note that either the provider, consumer or both may be subject to the payment of additional
  taxes and/or fees. We encourage you to check these Terms periodically for any changes.</p>

<p>HomeCooked, at its sole discretion, may make available promotional offers with different features to any user. These
  promotional offers, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your transaction.</p>

<p>HOMECOOKED SHALL NOT BEAR ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY COST, EXPENSE, LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT YOU MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A
  RESULT OF A PROVIDER&rsquo;S OR A CONSUMER&rsquo;S CANCELLATION OF A MEAL ORDER.</p>

<h2>Meals </h2>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all meals you post. Accordingly, you represent
  and warrant that any and all meals you post and/or transfer (i) will be accurate and truthful in all respects with
  respect to, among other things, the posted ingredients, the preparation of the meal, and the meal as cooked and
  transferred; (ii) will be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements and rules, including without
  limitation, criminal laws, health laws, zoning laws, license laws and any other applicable laws governing properties
  and food; and (iii) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties or conflict with the
  rights of third parties. Please note that HomeCooked assumes no responsibility for a user&rsquo;s compliance with the
  foregoing.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that HomeCooked does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for, or representative
  of, you as a provider, and if a consumer consumes your meal, any agreement you enter into with such consumer is
  between you and the consumer and HomeCooked is not a party thereto. Please note that HomeCooked reserves the right, at
  any time and without prior notice and in its sole discretion, to remove or disable access to any meal for any reason,
  including meals that HomeCooked, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of
  these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Application. Furthermore, the Application provides users with the opportunity
  to rate providers and provide additional feedback on user transactions. HomeCooked&rsquo;s policy, in its sole
  discretion, with respect to user ratings is to terminate the accounts of any provider who receives a &ldquo;zero
  rating&rdquo; or any equivalent thereof on two or more consecutive transactions.</p>

<p>If you are a provider, HomeCooked may make food packaging materials and related items available to you for purchase.
  You acknowledge and agree that should you purchase and use these materials, you do so at your own risk and with no
  warranty or guarantee of any kind from HomeCooked. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold HomeCooked or its
  officers, directors, employees or affiliates liable for any injury, damage or loss of any kind whatsoever resulting
  from, arising out of or related to the use of such materials.</p>

<h2>Ordering </h2>

<p>Providers, not HomeCooked, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed orders and making available any meals
  reserved through the Application. If you, as a consumer, choose to enter into a transaction with a provider for the
  ordering of a meal, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the provider
  and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such meal imposed by the
  provider. You</p>

<p>acknowledge and agree that you, and not HomeCooked, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such
  agreements, and HomeCooked is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to
  any such agreements.</p>

<p>Once HomeCooked receives confirmation of your order from the applicable provider, HomeCooked will collect the
  Administrative Fee in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable meal. Please note
  that HomeCooked cannot control any fees that may be charged to a consumer by her bank related to HomeCooked&rsquo;s
  collection of the Administrative Fee, and HomeCooked disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>

<p>In connection with your requested order, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name,
  billing address and credit card information either to HomeCooked or its third party payment processor. You agree to
  pay HomeCooked for any confirmed orders made in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the
  Application &ndash; e.g., by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging
  the credit card provided as part of requesting the order, either directly by HomeCooked or indirectly, via a third
  party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Application. If you are directed to
  HomeCooked&rsquo;s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that
  third party&rsquo;s service and that third party&rsquo;s personal information collection practices. Please review such
  terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed order transaction is complete
  you will receive a confirmation e-mail summarizing your confirmed order.</p>

<h2>Account Registration </h2>

  (including without limitation for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and
  conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating HomeCooked to pay any

  Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, shall be considered to be Application Content for
  all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that
  you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party
  Accounts will be available on and through your HomeCooked account on the Application. Please note that if a Third
  Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or HomeCooked&rsquo;s access to such Third Party Account is
  terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the
  Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your HomeCooked account and your Third Party
  Accounts, at any time, by accessing the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section of the Application.</p>

  provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall
  be enforced. HomeCooked&rsquo;s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive HomeCooked&rsquo;s
  right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and
  agreement between you and HomeCooked. Sections referring to services, licenses, liability limitation, indemnity, and
  resolution of disputes shall survive any termination, modification or expiration of these Terms.</p>
